[![Maven Central Status](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/com.mparticle/java-sdk/badge.svg?style=flat-square)](https://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cmparticle)

A Java library for building and deploying third-party extensions for [mParticle](https://www.mparticle.com) over Amazon's [Lambda platform](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/).

This library translates messages from the mParticle Firehose API into easy-to-use objects so that you can register and integrate your service with mParticle.

## What is mParticle Firehose?

mParticle aims to allow our customers to send their data wherever they want it to go, and we integrate with many services across the mobile-app ecosystem in order to achieve that. mParticle Firehose is an API that lets anybody become one of our integration partners. Leveraging Amazon AWS's [Lambda platform](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), mParticle will send your "lambda function" data as it comes into our system so that your function can then forward it along to your own API.
